A unique monetization opportunity with B2C AI applications could be the subscription model based on the personalization of the service.
Instead of relying on targeted advertising or product sales, AI companies could offer personalized services that are tailored to each user's
unique needs and preferences. These services could include product recommendations, personalized financial advisory services, 
or even personalized genomics-based health services.

To implement this model, AI companies would need to develop sophisticated algorithms that can analyze vast amounts of data from each user
to create a detailed profile of their preferences and needs. They would also need to invest in servers and hosting to store and process
the data, as well as staff training to provide personalized customer support.

However, this model could generate positive cash flow in the long run, as users would be willing to pay for a
personalized service that saves time and provides accurate results. Furthermore, AI companies could further monetize
these personalized services by selling anonymized data to companies that want to improve their marketing and advertising.
With the right marketing strategy,
AI companies could acquire and retain a loyal customer base willing to pay a monthly or annual subscription fee, 
allowing them to generate long-term recurring revenue.
